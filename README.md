# bobadex

Pokedex but for boba. 

## Basic Use
Allows users to add boba shops into their personal index, hence bobadex. Every entry requires a picture for the shops image in the user's bobadex. Users can add and rate individual drinks that they've tried from specific boba shops. User's can also add friends and view their bobadex's.
